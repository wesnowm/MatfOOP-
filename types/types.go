// ImageTransport is a top-level namespace for ways to to store/load an image.
// It should generally correspond to ImageSource/ImageDestination implementations.
//
// Note that ImageTransport is based on "ways the users refer to image storage", not necessarily on the underlying physical transport.
// For example, all Docker References would be used within a single "docker" transport, regardless of whether the images are pulled over HTTP or HTTPS
// (or, even, IPv4 or IPv6).
//
// OTOH all images using the same transport should (apart from versions of the image format), be interoperable.
// For example, several different ImageTransport implementations may be based on local filesystem paths,
// but using completely different formats for the contents of that path (a single tar file, a directory containing tarballs, a fully expanded container filesystem, ...)
//
// See also transports.KnownTransports.

// That's also why the various identification/formatting methods of this type do not support returning errors.
